tsindex
=======

This is the repository for the ado-file tsindex.ado. Tsindex takes data in time-series format and indexes numerical variables to a given time.

Roadmap going forward:

- Change the syntax to do multiple variables
- Try to make the time part more intuitive
- Add a help file

After the above are taken care of, I will submit to SSC.
